# ⚽ Predicting Success in Football Counter-Attacks

This project aims to predict whether a counter-attack in a football match will be successful (i.e., will enter the penalty box) based on sequences of pitch control matrices. The matrices are encoded by an autoencoder and analyzed by an LSTM for binary classification.

## 🚀 Project Pipeline

✅ **1) Generating Pitch Control Matrices**  
Each frame of a counter-attack is converted into a matrix representing ball possession control across the field.

✅ **2) Autoencoder**  
Trained in an **unsupervised** way on all pitch control matrices to generate compact embeddings of the frames. Once trained, its weights are frozen and used to encode new data for the LSTM.

✅ **3) LSTM**  
Trained on sequences of embeddings generated by the autoencoder to predict the probability of a successful counter-attack.

## ⚙️ Improvements Applied

- Reduced initial learning rate for more stable training.
- Increased dropout and added L2 regularization to reduce overfitting.
- Used EarlyStopping with restore_best_weights to stop training at the best epoch.
- Applied ReduceLROnPlateau to automatically adjust the learning rate when validation performance stagnated.
- Increased batch size to reduce fluctuations in validation metrics.
- Tuned the decision threshold to optimize the F1-score for the minority class.

## 📊 Results

- **Test set accuracy:** ~81%  
- **F1-score for the Success class:** 0.61 (using the optimal threshold of 0.45)  
- **Stable loss and accuracy curves** without abrupt spikes during training.
